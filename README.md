Simple designed email verification based on the laravel email verification features. Verify Email publishes the scaffolding to your laravel application that can be easily customized based on your own application's needs. The easiest way is to use [laravel breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) because it is designed the same way.

It is suggested to use [laravel breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze) but you don't need to. When you are not using the suggested package please get familiar with [laravel email verification](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/verification) before starting here.

## Installation

```bash
composer require jersyfi/laravel-verify-email
